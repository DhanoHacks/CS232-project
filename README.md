Description:

Evaluated different cache hierarchies (different sizes of L1, L2, LLC,inclusive/non-inclusive/Exclusive) and cache replacement policies, compared with a baseline cache hierarchy, and improved cache performance.


Usage:
* Move all relevant files for any metric you want to test for, to the relevant ChampSim folder
* Put either bash script in ChampSim folder to generate bulk data
* Already generated data is in data/ directory
* All results generated from relevant functions in data/generate_plot.py

Key Points:
* Traces used: bfs-14.trace.gz, cc-14.trace.gz ,sssp-14.trace.gz
* Cache sizes tested for L2C: 512 KB, 1 MB, 2 MB, 4 MB; for LLC: 2 MB, 4 MB, 8 MB, 16 MB
* Tested 0 size L2C and 0 size LLC caches by removing them from the cache hierarchy
* Replacement policies tested: lru, random, lfu, fifo, mru, drrip, srrip, ship
* Inclusive, Exclusive and Noninclusive caches implemented and tested against all replacement policies

Best Results:
* **BFS:** Non Inclusive, LLC Size = 0, L2C Size = 512 KB
* **CC:** Non Inclusive, LLC Size = 8 MB, L2C Size = 0, LLC Replacement Policy = drrip
* **SSSP:** Non Inclusive, LLC Size = 8 MB, L2C Size = 0, LLC Replacement Policy = lfu
